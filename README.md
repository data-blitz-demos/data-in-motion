# Governance with Data in Motion

## Overview

This repository accompanies a comprehensive guide for software engineers looking to create a proof-of-concept (POC) for data governance in motion, leveraging the Confluent Platform. The document provides step-by-step instructions, examples, and artifacts for designing and executing governance strategies within Kafka-based stream processing architectures.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Data Governance in Motion:** Overview of enforcing data quality and semantics in real-time data streams using Kafka.
- **Confluent Platform Schema Registry:** Managing schemas, ensuring compatibility, and enabling schema evolution.
- **Data Contracts:** Enforcing structure and semantics between data producers and consumers through shift-left methodologies.
- **Stream Governance:** Implementation of data quality rules, including:
  - Domain Validation Rules
  - Event Condition-Action Rules
  - Transformation Rules
  - Complex Migration Rules
- **Examples and Scenarios:** 
  - Schema Validation
  - Data Quality Governance
  - Complex Data Quality Governance
  - Data Transformation Governance

## Artifacts Included

- **Avro Schemas:** Example schemas for defining data structure.
- **Rule Sets:** JSON and CEL-based rule definitions for validating and transforming data.
- **Docker Compose Configurations:** Simplified deployment of the Confluent Platform for running examples.
- **Scripts and Commands:** Step-by-step instructions for running producers and consumers, registering schemas, and applying rules.

## Examples

### Example 1: Schema Validation
Demonstrates schema validation using the Confluent Schema Registry. Producers and consumers interact with the `order-transactions` topic to validate the Avro schema structure.

### Example 2: Data Quality Governance
Introduces data quality rules to enforce semantic correctness, such as age restrictions on records.

### Example 3: Complex Data Quality Governance
Expands governance to enforce complex rules like credit card type validation and ensures strict compliance with format constraints.

### Example 4: Data Transformation Governance
Showcases schema migration and compatibility management using JSONata-based rules for upgrading and downgrading schemas dynamically.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Curl
- jq library for JSON processing
- Confluent Platform (Enterprise Edition recommended)

## Setup and Usage

1. **Install Prerequisites**  
   - Download and install Docker, Curl, and jq.  
   - Set up the Confluent Platform.

2. **Deploy Confluent Platform**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Register Avro Schemas**  
   Use the provided Avro schema files to register with the Schema Registry.

4. **Run Examples**  
   Follow the examples in the paper to test various governance scenarios.

5. **Monitor and Validate**  
   Use the Confluent Control Center to monitor topics, schemas, and governance rules.
